## Install Terraform:
I downloaded the pre-compiled binary for Windows from https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install. Created a folder in my C: drive and named it ‘Terraform’. Unzipped the file and select the location of the ‘Terraform’ folder. 

I made sure the terraform binary is available on my ‘PATH’. File Explorer > Right clicked ‘This PC’ and selected ‘Properties’ > ‘About’ tab > Selected ‘Advanced system settings’ > In ‘Advanced’ tab, selected ‘Environment Variables’ > Selected the user variable ‘Path’, and selected ‘Edit’ > Selected ‘New’ > Typed ‘c:\terraform’, and selected OK. 

Verified the Terraform Installation. Opened PowerShell > Run terraform -help. To check what each command does, for example, run terraform -help state.
