In this project, I will destroy my Azure infrastructure using Terraform.
 
## Destroy Infrastructure:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform destroy. Enter the value ‘yes’.

The (-) prefix in the output indicates that the instance will be destroyed.

- terraform destroy: This command will remove all the resources that were created by my Terraform configuration. Terraform will compare the current state of your infrastructure with the state described in your Terraform configuration files and then proceed to delete any resources that are no longer defined in the configuration.
