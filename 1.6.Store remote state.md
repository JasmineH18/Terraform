## Environments Used:
- Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

In this project, I will migrate my state to HCP Terraform. Building, changing, and destroying infrastructure is great for testing and development. In production environments, your state should be secure and encrypted, where your teammates can access it to collaborate on infrastructure. Using remote state in Terraform is considered a best practice for managing infrastructure as code in a team environment. 
 
## Created an HCP Terraform account: 

Went to https://app.terraform.io/public/signup/account?utm_source=learn. Input my information > Confirmed my email address > Created a new organization > Created a new workspace using ‘CLI-Driven Workflow’.

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Terraform is a managed service by HashiCorp for running Terraform workspaces in the cloud. It simplifies provisioning and managing infrastructure without the need for backend setup. Users can securely store state files, collaborate on projects, and benefit from scalability and reliability. This service streamlines workspace and infrastructure management, facilitating infrastructure as code adoption in the cloud.

## Set up HCP Terraform:

In my main.tf file, I added the cloud block below in my configuration and saved it.

cloud {
  organization = "Electric_Cloud-100"
    
  workspaces {
    name = "Terraform_Azure-100"
  }
}

- "cloud" is a block representing the cloud environment being defined.
- "organization" is an attribute within the "cloud" block, specifying the name of the organization (Electric Cloud) associated with this cloud environment. 
- "workspaces" is a nested block within the "cloud" block, representing different workspaces within the clou-d environment.
- Within the "workspaces" block, there is an attribute "name" specifying the name of a specific workspace (Terraform Azure). 

## Authenticate with HCP Terraform:

In the Command Prompt, run terraform login and enter the value ‘yes’ to proceed. Signed in to my HCP Terraform account. Made sure I was in the ‘Tokens’ tab. Selected ‘Create an API token’ > Copy and paste my token in the Command Prompt terminal.

## Migrated the state file:

In the VSCode terminal, run terraform init. Enter the value ‘yes’.

The "terraform init" command is used in Terraform to initialize a Terraform working directory. When you run "terraform init," Terraform will initialize the directory and download any necessary plugins and modules specified in the configuration files.

- Initializes backend: Terraform uses a backend to store state files and manage remote state. The "terraform init" command initializes the backend configuration specified in the Terraform files.
- Downloads providers: Terraform uses providers to interact with various cloud providers, APIs, and services. The "terraform init" command downloads the necessary provider plugins based on the provider configurations specified in the Terraform files.
- Downloads modules: Terraform modules are reusable components that can be used across different Terraform configurations. The "terraform init" command downloads any modules specified in the configuration files.

I deleted the local stat file. In the VSCode terminal, run rm terraform.tfstate.

## Configure a Service Principal: 

Opened Command Prompt, run az login. The Azure browser will open. I signed in with my credentials. Return to the Command Prompt to see my subscriptions information. In the Command Prompt, run az account list. Copied my ‘id’ column, and run az account set --subscription "My subscription ID".

- Azure login (az login) is a command in the Azure CLI used to authenticate and sign in to an Azure account. It allows users to securely access and manage their Azure resources by entering their credentials. This enables users to interact with their resources, deploy applications, and perform tasks using the Azure CLI.
- az account list: This command is used in the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) to list all the Azure subscriptions associated with the currently authenticated account. It will display information about each Azure subscription, including details such as the subscription ID, subscription name, tenant ID, and the current state of the subscription.
- az account set --subscription “My subscription ID”: is used in the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) to set a specific Azure subscription as the active subscription for the current session. You can access resources and services associated with that particular subscription.

In Command Prompt, run cd C:\Terraform > Run az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<MY_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>".

The command "az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"” is used in Azure CLI to create a service principal with the Contributor role at the subscription level. Allowing the service principal to manage Azure resources within that subscription.

- az ad sp create-for-rbac: This command is used to create a service principal for role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Active Directory.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model used by cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure to manage access to resources based on roles assigned to users or service principals. RBAC in Azure allows administrators to define roles with specific sets of permissions, such as read, write, delete, or manage, and then assign those roles to users, groups, or service principals.
- --role="Contributor": This specifies the role assigned to the service principal. The Contributor role grants full access to manage resources within the specified scope.
- --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>": This defines the scope at which the role assignment applies. It specifies the subscription level where the service principal will have Contributor access.

## Update the HCP Terraform environment variables:

In the HCP Terraform UI, I went to my Terraform Azure workspace. Went to the ‘Variables’ tab and created the environment variables below. I set the ARM_CLIENT_SECRET as a sensitive value. Updated and saved the environment variables. In my main.tf file, I updated the ‘provider’ block with the second code below and saved it.

ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
ARM_CLIENT_ID = "<APPID_VALUE>"
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "<PASSWORD_VALUE>"
ARM_TENANT_ID = "<TENANT_VALUE>"

provider "azurerm" {
   subscription_id = ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
   client id            = ARM_CLIENT_ID
   client secret      = ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
   tenant id           = ARM_TENANT_ID	
   features {}
}

## Apply the configuration:

In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply.

## Destroy the infrastructure:

In the VSCode terminal, run terraform destroy.
