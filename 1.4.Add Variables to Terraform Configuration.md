## Resources Used:
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-variables

## Environments Used:
- Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

In this project, I will add variables to my Terraform configuration.
 
## Defined my variables:
In my Terraform Azure directory, I created a file called variables.tf. Added the variable declaration below and saved it.

variable "resource_group_name" {
  default = "myTFResourceGroup"
}

- The code defines a variable named "resource_group_name" with a default value of "myTFResourceGroup". This means that if a value for the variable "resource_group_name" is not explicitly provided when running Terraform, it will default to "myTFResourceGroup". Variables in Terraform allow you to parameterize your configurations, making them more flexible and reusable. By defining variables, you can easily customize your Terraform configurations without having to hardcode values directly into your code.

## Updated my Terraform configuration with my variables: 

In my main.tf file, I updated my azurerm_resource_group configuration with the variable below and saved it.

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = "eastus2"

The resource block is defined for creating an Azure Resource Group using the "azurerm_resource_group" resource type. The resource block is named "rg" and includes two attributes:

- name: This attribute specifies the name of the resource group and is set to the value of the variable "resource_group_name". The value of this attribute will be dynamically determined based on the value provided for the variable "resource_group_name".
- location: This attribute specifies the location where the resource group will be created, in this case, "eastus2".

## Apply my configuration:

In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply. Enter the value ‘yes’.

In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply -var "resource_group_name=myNewResourceGroupName". Enter the value ‘yes’.

- The command "terraform apply -var 'resource_group_name=myNewResourceGroupName'" is used in Terraform to apply a configuration while providing a variable override. The variable "resource_group_name" is being overridden with a new value of "myNewResourceGroupName". Terraform will apply the configuration defined in my Terraform files, creating or updating resources as necessary. The "-var" flag is used to pass a variable override to Terraform during the apply process. By specifying "-var 'resource_group_name=myNewResourceGroupName'", I’m instructing Terraform to use the value "myNewResourceGroupName" for the variable "resource_group_name" instead of its default or previously defined value.
