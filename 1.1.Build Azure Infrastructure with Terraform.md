## Resources Used:
-	https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-build

## Environments Used:
- Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

In this project, I will deploy an Azure resource group by creating a Terraform configuration.

## Install the Azure CLI tool:
I opened PowerShell as an administrator. Run Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows -OutFile .\AzureCLI.msi; Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList '/I AzureCLI.msi /quiet'; rm .\AzureCLI.msi.

Azure CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by Microsoft for managing Azure resources. It allows users to interact with Azure services and resources through a text-based interface, enabling tasks such as creating and managing virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking components.

- Use Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet to download Azure CLI installer from the specified URI: https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows.
- Save the downloaded Azure CLI installer as AzureCLI.msi in the current directory using the -OutFile parameter.
- Start the installation process of Azure CLI using Start-Process cmdlet with msiexec.exe, waiting for the installation to complete with the -Wait parameter.
- Pass the arguments '/I AzureCLI.msi /quiet' to msiexec.exe to install Azure CLI silently without user interaction.
- Remove the downloaded AzureCLI.msi file from the current directory using the rm command.

## Authenticate Terraform to Azure:
Opened Command Prompt, run az login. The Azure browser will open. I signed in with my credentials. Return to the Command Prompt to see my subscriptions information. Copied my ‘id’ column, and run az account set --subscription "My subscription ID".

- Azure login (az login) is a command in the Azure CLI used to authenticate and sign in to an Azure account. It allows users to securely access and manage their Azure resources by entering their credentials. This enables users to interact with their resources, deploy applications, and perform tasks using the Azure CLI.
- az account set --subscription “My subscription ID”: is used in the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) to set a specific Azure subscription as the active subscription for the current session. You can access resources and services associated with that particular subscription.

## Create a Service Principal:
In Azure portal website, I went to Azure Active Directory now called Microsoft Entra ID from Azure Services. Selected ‘App Registrations’ tab > ‘New Registration’. Typed ‘Terraform’ in the ‘Name’ section and selected the ‘Supported account types’ to be single tenant and clicked ‘Register’. 

- A Service Principal is an application within Azure Active Directory with the authentication tokens Terraform needs to perform actions on your behalf.
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service, offering a comprehensive solution for securely managing user identities and resource access. It includes features like single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and integration with numerous SaaS applications. Azure AD centralizes user management, enforces security policies, and simplifies resource access across platforms and devices, playing a vital role in identity security, application access management, and compliance.
- Azure App Registrations is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to register their applications and integrate them with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). By registering an application, users can obtain an application ID and authentication keys that can be used to authenticate and authorize the application to access Azure resources. This service enables secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for applications that interact with Azure services and resources.

In Command Prompt, run cd C:\Terraform > Run az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<MY_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>".

The command "az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"” is used in Azure CLI to create a service principal with the Contributor role at the subscription level. Allowing the service principal to manage Azure resources within that subscription.

- az ad sp create-for-rbac: This command is used to create a service principal for role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Active Directory.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model used by cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure to manage access to resources based on roles assigned to users or service principals. RBAC in Azure allows administrators to define roles with specific sets of permissions, such as read, write, delete, or manage, and then assign those roles to users, groups, or service principals.
- --role="Contributor": This specifies the role assigned to the service principal. The Contributor role grants full access to manage resources within the specified scope.
- --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>": This defines the scope at which the role assignment applies. It specifies the subscription level where the service principal will have Contributor access.

## Setting my environment variables:
“HashiCorp recommends setting these values as environment variables rather than saving them in your Terraform configuration.”

- Environment variables are dynamic values that influence the behavior of processes on a computer system, storing configuration settings, system paths, and other accessible information for applications and operating systems. Set at the operating system level, these variables are accessible to programs and scripts, offering a standardized method for software applications to access crucial information like system paths, user preferences, and configuration settings. They enable customization of application behavior, management of program interactions with the operating system, and maintenance of a consistent environment for software development and deployment.

In PowerShell, run the commands below with my information.

$Env:ARM_CLIENT_ID = "<APPID_VALUE>"
$Env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "<PASSWORD_VALUE>"
$Env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
$Env:ARM_TENANT_ID = "<TENANT_VALUE>"

- $Env:ARM_CLIENT_ID = "<APPID_VALUE>": This line sets the ARM_CLIENT_ID environment variable to the specified <APPID_VALUE>, which represents the Application ID (Client ID) of the Azure AD application used for authentication.
- $Env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "<PASSWORD_VALUE>": This line sets the ARM_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable to the specified <PASSWORD_VALUE>, which represents the client secret (password) associated with the Azure AD application for authentication.
- $Env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>": This line sets the ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable to the specified <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, which represents the Azure subscription ID that the script will operate within.
- $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID = "<TENANT_VALUE>": This line sets the ARM_TENANT_ID environment variable to the specified <TENANT_VALUE>, which represents the Azure AD tenant ID associated with the Azure AD directory where the Azure resources are located.

## Write the configuration:
In PowerShell, I created a folder called ‘Terraform Azure’. Run New-Item -Path "c:\" -Name "Terraform Azure" -ItemType "directory". 

- New-Item: This PowerShell command is used to create a new item, such as a file or directory, at a specified location.
- -Path "c:\": Specifies the location where the new item will be created, in this case, the root directory of the C: drive.
- -Name "Terraform Azure": Specifies the name of the new item to be created, in this case, a directory named "Terraform Azure".
- -ItemType "directory": Specifies the type of item to be created, in this case, a directory.

In VSCode, I installed three extensions called, ‘Azure CLI Tools’ and ‘HashiCorp Terraform’. Bracket Pair Colorizer extension is deprecated in VSCode, as it’s built in VSCode. Went to my settings to make sure it’s enabled. Opened the ‘Terraform Azure’ folder in VSCode, created a new file called ‘main.tf’, and added the configuration below.

Configure the Azure provider:
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0.2"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "myTFResourceGroup"
  location = "eastus2"
}

The Terraform configuration is used to configure the Azure provider and create an Azure resource group using Terraform. 

Terraform Block:
- The `terraform` block is used to configure the required providers and specify the Terraform version.
- `required_providers` block specifies the required Azure provider (azurerm) with its source (“hashicorp/azurerm”) and version (“~> 3.0.2”).
- `required_version` specifies the minimum Terraform version required for this configuration (“>= 1.1.0”).

Provider Block:
- The `provider "azurerm"` block configures the Azure provider with additional features (in this case, an empty `features` block).

Resource Block:
- The `resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg"` block defines an Azure resource group resource named `myTFResourceGroup`.
- Within this block, the `name` parameter specifies the name of the resource group as `myTFResourceGroup`, and the `location` parameter specifies the location of the resource group as `eastus2`.

## Initialized my Terraform configuration:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform init.

The "terraform init" command is used in Terraform to initialize a Terraform working directory. When you run "terraform init," Terraform will initialize the directory and download any necessary plugins and modules specified in the configuration files.

- Initializes backend: Terraform uses a backend to store state files and manage remote state. The "terraform init" command initializes the backend configuration specified in the Terraform files.
- Downloads providers: Terraform uses providers to interact with various cloud providers, APIs, and services. The "terraform init" command downloads the necessary provider plugins based on the provider configurations specified in the Terraform files.
- Downloads modules: Terraform modules are reusable components that can be used across different Terraform configurations. The "terraform init" command downloads any modules specified in the configuration files.

## Format and validate the configuration:
Format the Configuration:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform fmt

Validate the configuration:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform validate

- The "terraform fmt" command is used in Terraform to format Terraform configuration files in a standardized and consistent manner. When you run "terraform fmt", Terraform automatically rewrites the configuration files in a canonical format with proper indentation, spacing, and ordering of elements. This command helps ensure that your Terraform code is well-formatted, making it easier to read, maintain, and collaborate with other team members.
- The "terraform validate" command is used in Terraform, to check the syntax and validity of Terraform configuration files before applying them to create or modify infrastructure resources. When you run "terraform validate", Terraform reads the configuration files in the current directory and validates them against the Terraform language syntax and provider requirements.

## Apply my Terraform Configuration:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply. Went to my Azure portal website and went to the ‘Resource Groups’. I validated that my resource group was created.

- The "terraform apply" command is used in Terraform to apply the changes defined in your Terraform configuration files to your infrastructure. When you run "terraform apply," Terraform compares the current state of your infrastructure with the desired state defined in your configuration files and then creates, updates, or deletes resources as necessary to make the actual infrastructure match the desired state.

Before applying changes, Terraform will show you a plan of what actions it will take based on the configuration changes. You can review this plan and confirm whether you want to proceed with applying the changes. Once you confirm, Terraform will execute the plan and make the necessary changes to your infrastructure.

## Inspect my state:
Inspect the current state:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform show. 

Review the information in my state file:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform state list. 

If I wanted to view or manipulate the configuration:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform state.

- The "terraform show" command displays the current state of your infrastructure defined in Terraform configuration files, providing a human-readable representation of resource details and dependencies. This command helps review provisioned resources, understand relationships between them, and troubleshoot any provisioning issues. Utilizing "terraform show" offers insights into your infrastructure's state managed by Terraform, aiding in effective infrastructure management and maintenance.
- The "terraform state list" command is used in Terraform to list all the resources that are currently being managed by Terraform and are stored in the Terraform state file. By using "terraform state list," you can get a clear overview of the resources that Terraform is managing, which can be helpful for troubleshooting, auditing, and understanding the current state of your infrastructure managed by Terraform.
- The "terraform state" command in Terraform is used to interact with Terraform's state files, which store information about the infrastructure managed by Terraform. The state files contain details about the resources created and managed by Terraform, such as resource IDs, attributes, dependencies, and metadata. With the "terraform state" command, you can perform various operations on the Terraform state, such as viewing the current state, inspecting resource attributes, moving resources between states, and manually manipulating the state file.
