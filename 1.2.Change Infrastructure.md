## Resources Used:
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-change

## Environments Used:
- Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

In this project, I will modify my configuration to include an additional new resource referencing my resource group and add tags.
 
## Created a new resource:
I’m going to create a virtual network (VNet) by adding the resource block below.

- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a service in Microsoft Azure that lets you create secure, isolated networks in the cloud. You can define IP address spaces, subnets, route tables, and security policies to connect Azure resources, virtual machines, and on-premises networks securely. VNet allows you to segment your infrastructure into multiple subnets with individual security and routing settings, enabling traffic control, network security implementation, and resource connectivity within the virtual network.

I went to my main.tf file in VSCode. Added the resource block at the bottom and saved the file.

Create a virtual network:
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "myTFVnet"
  address_space       = ["XXX.XX.XX.X/XX"]
  location            = "eastus2"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
}

- azurerm_virtual_network: This is the Terraform resource type for creating an Azure Virtual Network.
- vnet: Is the name given to this specific virtual network resource instance.
- name: Is the parameter specifying the name of the virtual network, set to "myTFVnet" in this case.
- address_space: Is the parameter defining the IP address space for the virtual network. The value ["XXX.XX.XX.X/XX"] represents the CIDR notation for the IP address range allocated to the virtual network.
- location: Specifies the Azure region where the virtual network will be created, set to "eastus2" in this example.
- resource_group_name: is the parameter that references the Azure resource group where the virtual network will be deployed. The code snippet uses the name of an existing resource group created earlier in the Terraform configuration.

 ## Apply my changes:
 In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply.

- The "terraform apply" command is used in Terraform to apply the changes defined in your Terraform configuration files to your infrastructure. When you run "terraform apply," Terraform compares the current state of your infrastructure with the desired state defined in your configuration files and then creates, updates, or deletes resources as necessary to make the actual infrastructure match the desired state.

Before applying changes, Terraform will show you a plan of what actions it will take based on the configuration changes. You can review this plan and confirm whether you want to proceed with applying the changes. Once you confirm, Terraform will execute the plan and make the necessary changes to your infrastructure.

## Modify an existing resource:
In the main.tf file, I updated the ‘azurerm_resource_group’ resource by adding the tags block below and saved it.

Tags can be assigned to Azure resources in a Terraform configuration. Tags are defined as key-value pairs within curly braces. The tags specify additional metadata about the Azure resources, such as the environment and the team responsible for managing them. You can categorize and organize resources based on different criteria, making it easier to manage, monitor, and track them within your Azure environment. Tags can be used for cost allocation, resource grouping, and other organizational purposes.

  tags = {
     Environment = "Terraform Getting Started"
     Team = "Azure"
  }
}

- The key "Environment" is assigned the value "Terraform Getting Started", indicating the environment or project to which the resources belong.
- The key "Team" is assigned the value "Azure", specifying the team within the organization that is responsible for the resources.

## Apply my changes:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform apply.

- The prefix ~ means that Terraform will update the resource in-place.

## Review updates to state:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform show.

Review the updated information in my state file:
In the VSCode terminal, run terraform state list.

- The "terraform show" command displays the current state of your infrastructure defined in Terraform configuration files, providing a human-readable representation of resource details and dependencies.
- The "terraform state list" command is used in Terraform to list all the resources that are currently being managed by Terraform and are stored in the Terraform state file.
