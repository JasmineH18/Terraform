## Resources Used:
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-outputs

## Environments Used:
- Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

In this project, I will use output values to organize data to be easily queried and displayed.
 
## Define an output:
In my Terraform Azure directory, I created a file called outputs.tf. Added the output definition below and saved it.

output "resource_group_id" {
  value = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id
}

An output block is defined to output the ID of the Azure Resource Group that was created using the resource block for "azurerm_resource_group" named "rg".

- The output block is named "resource_group_id".
- "value": This attribute specifies the value that will be output when the configuration is applied. The value is set to "azurerm_resource_group.rg.id".

## Observed my resource outputs:

In my main.tf file terminal, run terraform apply. Enter the value ‘yes’.

- Using ‘apply’ only returns the outputs.

You can query the output using the ‘output’ command with the output ID. In my main.tf file terminal, run terraform output resource_group_id.

- "terraform output": This command is used to extract and display the values of output variables defined in my Terraform configuration.
